10 Mar 2014  Fixed bugs in unimodular.{4,5}way.py, which resulted in
              incorrect test results or abnormal termination

             Fredrik Johansson, thanks for help. 
             
             The secret method _clean_cache() is really hard to find.

20140312-r0 flint.pyx, class fmpz_mat:
             wrapped fmpz_mat_solve() as solve_right(); 
             added __richcmp__()
            
            benchmark_solve_right.py: benchmarked solve_right() in flint_sage and 
             Sage
            
            Anybody feels like implementing a good interface to Dixon method? 
            Question answered, thanks Fredrick

20140313-r1: fmpq_mat constructor workin

20140314-r0: Some fmpq_mat methods wrapped. benchmark_Dixon_square.py terminated.
             Sage .inverse() is a winner for matrix larger than 170

15 Mar 2014  Spent few hours wrapping methods nmod_mat_

             Tests show that nmod_mat_rref does not preserve matrice determinant, and 
              nmod_mat_lu* malfunction for non-prime moduli
              
             So how do I count HNF over ring? Do I need to use NTL HNF? 
             
             I wonder what fmpz_mat_fflu, fmpz_mat_rref, 
              fmpz_mat_rref_fraction_free do
