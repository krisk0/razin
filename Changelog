10 Mar 2014  Fixed bugs in unimodular.{4,5}way.py, which resulted in
              incorrect test results or abnormal termination

             Fredrik Johansson, thanks for help. 
             
             The secret method _clean_cache() is really hard to find.

20140312-r0 flint.pyx, class fmpz_mat:
             wrapped fmpz_mat_solve() as solve_right(); 
             added __richcmp__()
            
            benchmark_solve_right.py: benchmarked solve_right() in flint_sage and Sage
            
            Anybody feels like implementing a good interface to Dixon method?

20140313-r1: fmpq_mat constructor workin

20140314-r0: Some fmpq_mat methods wrapped. benchmark_Dixon_square.py terminated.
             Sage .inverse() is a winner for matrix larger than 170
