11 Mar 2014 Add Python interface to FLINT functions solving matrice 
             equation and counting HNF over Z/nZ.
             
            fmpz_mat_solve+ nmod_mat_rref 
             
            Test the new functions by implementing a fragment of Stein
             double-determinant algorithm. When test passes, benchmark.
