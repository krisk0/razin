*.cout                Output of python script (usually benchmark or test result)
*.py                  .py in root directory: Python script, usually benchmarks, usually requires

flint.binding/        Python binding for small piece of FLINT library, requires
                       sage. Installs as flint_sage. Tests in separate files test* 

unimodular.5way.py    Benchmark 5 ways of checking a 100x100 matrice for 
                       unimodularity
unimodular.4way.py    unimodular.5way.py reduced to not use FLINT
unimodular.5way.cout  Benchmark results for my desksop, with CPU specs as known 
                       to uname. Re-running the program gives slightly different
                       result.
